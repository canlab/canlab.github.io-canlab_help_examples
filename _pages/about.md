Below are how-to examples that publish HTML files with code and output. These examples require the [CAN Lab Core Tools Repository](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore). The help examples focus on the CANlabâ€™s interactive object-oriented tools.
Running the examples also serves as a preliminary unit testing frame for the CANlab tools.

Please document errors by posting issues on the [CAN Lab Github page](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabScripts/issues).
