Below are examples consisting of code, results, and figures for each section. These examples require the [CAN Lab Core Tools Repository](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabCore).
Running the examples in your own environment also serves as a preliminary unit test frame for the CAN Lab tools.

Please document errors by posting issues on the [CAN Lab Github page](https://github.com/canlab/CanlabScripts/issues).
